# About Fetch IP Address for Android
This is a short - spanning only one Activity - but useful script for programmers in Android development to extract information relating to an IP address from IP2Location. This script obtains the following information from IP2Location where available:
* IP Address
* Country code


# Instructions
You can copy and paste this code. You only need to edit the variable identified as APIKEY (which indicates the API key you should have obtained from IP2Location. Contact them if you would like information on how to receive this) as well as ipADDRESS (which refers to the IP Address you would like to obtain information for). 

# Requirements
* Android Studio, Eclipse or a similar Integrated Development Environment.
* Windows, Mac or Linux
It is not necessary to have a physical Android device but you can test it on your device as well if that suits your fancy.
